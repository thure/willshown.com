<p><abbr title="γιγνώσκων, εἶδος, ὄντος, φαίνων">GEOF</abbr> is an open source sci-fi game engine designed to create an immersive and imaginative setting from naturalistic simulations. So far it’s just barely begun.</p>
<p>Currently it’s able to <a href="https://twitter.com/wwwillshown/status/493287591811096576" target="_blank">simulate the orbits</a> of our Sun’s planets and all of the exoplanets for which we have orbital elements.</p>
<p>Planned features include simulation of geography/erosion, climate, economic markets, politics, espionage, and theaters of war. Hopefully, GEOF will eventually provide gamers connected, nuanced, believable in-game experiences.</p>
