<p><abbr title="γιγνώσκων, εἶδος, ὄντος, φαίνων">GEOF</abbr> is an open source sci-fi game engine designed to create an immersive and imaginative setting from naturalistic simulations. So far several open source libraries have been produced that will act as a foundation for planned features.</p>
<p>Currently it’s able to <a href="https://github.com/G-E-O-F/peels#readme" target="_blank">store information in a geodesic sphere</a> and determine <a href="https://github.com/G-E-O-F/warmth#readme" target="_blank">how much sunlight is received by any location on a stellar body</a>.</p>
<p>Planned features include simulation of geography/erosion, climate, economic markets, politics, espionage, and theaters of war. Hopefully, GEOF will eventually provide gamers connected, nuanced, believable in-game experiences.</p>
