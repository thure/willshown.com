<p>Brewing is hard. To do it right, temperature and timing are extremely important, <a href="http://braukaiser.com/wiki/images/8/8c/Mash_diagram_tripple_decoction.gif" target="_blank">especially for lagers</a>. In homebrewing, the intricacies of mashing are often designed in advance, but without automation it can be difficult to carry out those designs.</p>
<p>Pi Brewer is an attempt to automate the trickier parts of homebrewing. The circuit board allows a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> to read from industry standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_thermometer" target="_blank">Pt100</a> temperature sensors and control solenoid valves and electrical heating elements.</p>
